Java Keywords List:
====================
1)Data types :
-int->The int keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.

-char->Defines a character variable capable of holding any character of the java source file's character set.

-short->The short keyword is used to declare a field that can hold a 16-bit signed two's complement integer.

-long->The long keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit signed two's complement integer.

-float->The float keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit single precision IEEE 754 floating-point number.

-double->The double keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit double precision IEEE 754 floating-point number.

-boolean->Defines a boolean variable for the values "true" or "false" only. By default, the value of boolean primitive type is false.
 
-byte->The byte keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.


2)Access specifiers :
- private->The private keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; private members can only be accessed by other members of their own class
-public->The public keyword is used in the declaration of a class, method, or field; public classes, methods, and fields can be accessed by the members of any class.
-protected->The protected keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; protected members can only be accessed by members of their own class, that class's subclasses or classes from the same package.

3)Control flow :
 -if->The if keyword is used to create an if statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the if statement is executed. 
-else->The else keyword is used in conjunction with if to create an if-else statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the if are evaluated; if it evaluates to false, the block of statements associated with the else are evaluated.

-for->The for keyword is used to create a for loop, which specifies a variable initialization, a boolean expression, and an incrementation. The variable initialization is performed first, and then the boolean expression is evaluated. If the expression evaluates to true, the block of statements associated with the loop are executed, and then the incrementation is performed. The boolean expression is then evaluated again; this continues until the expression evaluates to false

-while->The while keyword is used to create a while loop, which tests a boolean expression and executes the block of statements associated with the loop if the expression evaluates to true; this continues until the expression evaluates to false. This keyword can also be used to create a do-while loop;
-break->Used to end the execution in the current loop body.

-coninue->Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, continue resumes execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

-switch->The switch keyword is used in conjunction with case and default to create a switch statement, which evaluates a variable, matches its value to a specific case, and executes the block of statements associated with that case. If no case matches the value, the optional block labelled by default is executed, if included.

-case->A statement in the switch block can be labeled with one or more case or default labels. The switch statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label; see switch.

-do->he do keyword is used in conjunction with while to create a do-while loop, which executes a block of statements associated with the loop and then tests a boolean expression associated with the while. If the expression evaluates to true, the block is executed again; this continues until the expression evaluates to false.


4)Exception handling :
-try->Defines a block of statements that have exception handling. If an exception is thrown inside the try block, an optional catch block can handle declared exception types. Also, an optional finally block can be declared that will be executed when execution exits the try block and catch clauses, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. A try block must have at least one catch clause or a finally block.

-catch->Used in conjunction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.

-throw->Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the catch keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught exception handler.

-throws->Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of RuntimeException must be declared using the throws keyword.

5)other keywords :
-class->A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class

-extends->Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass; used in an interface declaration to specify one or more superinterfaces.A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. 

-abstract->A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. 

-assert->Assert describes a predicate (a true–false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. 

-const->Unused but reserved.

-default->The default keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed if no case matches the specified value;

-enum->A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class Enum

-final->Define an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. More specifically: a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command. 

-finally->Used to define a block of statements for a block defined previously by the try keyword. The finally block is executed after execution exits the try block and any associated catch clauses regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught, or execution left method in the middle of the try or catch blocks using the return keyword.

-goto->unused

-implements->Included in a class declaration to specify one or more interfaces that are implemented by the current class. A class inherits the types and abstract methods declared by the interfaces.

-import->Used at the beginning of a source file to specify classes or entire Java packages to be referred to later without including their package names in the reference. Since J2SE 5.0, import statements can import static members of a class.

-instanceof->A binary operator that takes an object reference as its first operand and a class or interface as its second operand and produces a boolean result. The instanceof operator evaluates to true if and only if the runtime type of the object is assignment compatible with the class or interface.

-interface->Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract or default methods, constant (static final) fields and static interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the implements keyword. As multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, interfaces are used to circumvent it. An interface can be defined within another interface.

-native->Used in method declarations to specify that the method is not implemented in the same Java source file, but rather in another language.

-new->Used to create an instance of a class or array object. Using keyword for this end is not completely necessary (as exemplified by Scala), though it serves two purposes: it enables the existence of different namespace for methods and class names, it defines statically and locally that a fresh object is indeed created, and of what runtime type it is (arguably introducing dependency into the code).

-package->Java package is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the package keyword.

-static->Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. static also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of to a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. 

-strictfp->A Java keyword used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations to ensure portability.

-super->Inheritance basically used to achieve dynamic binding or run-time polymorphism in java. Used to access members of a class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of its superclass.

-synchronized->Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the current thread executes the code.[8] For static methods, the object locked is the class's Class. Guarantees that at most one thread at a time operating on the same object executes that code.

-0this->Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. this can be used to access class members and as a reference to the current instance. 

-transient->Declares that an instance field is not part of the default serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized, only the values of its non-transient instance fields are included in the default serial representation.

-void->The void keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value.

-volatile->Used in field declarations to guarantee visibility of changes to variables across threads. Every read of a volatile variable will be read from main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache.
